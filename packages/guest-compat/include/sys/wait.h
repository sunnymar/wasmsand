/* POSIX <sys/wait.h> — wasi-libc doesn't ship one because WASI has
 * no traditional wait/waitpid model.  Codepod's process kernel does
 * track child PIDs (host_waitpid is async; host_waitpid_nohang is
 * sync), but exposing them under the standard libc names requires
 * a compat shim that we haven't wired yet (it would need a sync
 * polling loop or JSPI suspending from a sync libc call site).
 *
 * For the purposes of building POSIX C code that compiles regardless
 * of whether wait/waitpid actually work, we expose:
 *   - the W* macros for parsing exit status integers (pure
 *     bitfield operations, no syscalls)
 *   - WNOHANG / WUNTRACED / WCONTINUED option flags
 *   - wait/waitpid prototypes that return -1/ECHILD at runtime —
 *     posix_spawn'd children are reaped via host_waitpid_nohang
 *     elsewhere, not through this header
 *
 * Programs that do not actually call wait()/waitpid() at runtime
 * (the common case after `--disable-*` flags strip decompressor
 * pipelines and similar fork-using paths) will compile and link
 * with no observable issue.

 * the right behaviour for synthetic statuses too. */
