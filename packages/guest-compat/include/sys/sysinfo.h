/* sysinfo(2) — Linux extension that wasi-libc doesn't ship.  Codepod
 * provides a real implementation in libcodepod_guest_compat
 * (codepod_sysinfo.c) that reads /proc/uptime, /proc/meminfo, and
 * /proc/loadavg, so callers see live values rather than constants.
 *
 * The struct layout matches Linux's so existing C code (BusyBox,
 * sysstat, gnulib, etc.) keeps working unchanged. */
