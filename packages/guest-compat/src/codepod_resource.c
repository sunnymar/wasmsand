/* getrlimit(2) / setrlimit(2) — wasi-sdk declares them in
 * <sys/resource.h> but ships no implementation.  Many configure
 * scripts probe for them (e.g. to size buffers), and several real
 * programs query RLIMIT_NOFILE or RLIMIT_STACK during startup.
 *
 * Codepod's resource semantics are quite different from a real OS:
 * the sandbox is process-isolated, not user-isolated, and most
 * limits are enforced at the WASI layer (memory cap via wasm
 * linear-memory limit, deadline timeouts via cancellation, output
 * caps via FdTable buffer ceilings).  So `getrlimit` reports the
 * underlying mechanism's *effective* cap (rounded if needed) and
 * `setrlimit` accepts requests but is a no-op above the policy
 * minimums — the kernel-side caps win.
 *
 * Defaults below mirror what a small Linux sandbox would report.
 * Programs that just want "is this absurdly low or absurdly high"
 * see reasonable values.
