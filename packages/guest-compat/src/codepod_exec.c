/* execv / execvp / execve — POSIX process-image replacement.
 *
 * wasm has no native process-replacement primitive; the WASI
 * `process-replace` proposal isn't standardized.  Codepod's process
 * kernel does have host_spawn (used by posix_spawn) and host_waitpid,
 * which together can emulate exec semantics:
 *
 *   1. spawn the new program with the caller's current stdin/stdout/
 *      stderr fds and environment
 *   2. wait for it to exit
 *   3. exit with its exit code
 *
 * The caller process never resumes.  This is functionally equivalent
 * to a real exec for any program that fits the
 * "fork-then-exec-then-wait" pattern (which is the common one).  The
 * differences from a real exec are bookkeeping:
 *
 * - getpid() in the new program returns a NEW pid (not the caller's).
 *   Real exec preserves pid; we don't.  Programs that rely on pid
 *   continuity across exec (uncommon outside daemonization tricks)
 *   will see the discontinuity.
 * - The caller's wasm instance is still around in memory until the
 *   child exits; in real exec, the caller's image is gone immediately.
 *   For the sandbox this means slightly higher peak memory; semantically
 *   transparent.
 *
 * On failure (program not found, spawn rejected, etc.) exec returns
 * -1 with errno set, mirroring POSIX.
