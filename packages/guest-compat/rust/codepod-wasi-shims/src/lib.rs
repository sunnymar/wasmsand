//! Runtime-library replacements for wasip1 stdlib functions that panic
//! (`library/std/src/sys/pal/wasi/os.rs`). Each shim is exported under a
//! stable `#[export_name = "__codepod_wasi_shim_*"]` identifier.
//!
//! Consumers add this crate as a direct dependency. After link, the
//! `codepod-wasi-postlink` binary scans the resulting .wasm for the
//! mangled stdlib symbols listed in `codepod-wasi-postlink`'s target
//! table and rewrites each body to a tail-call into the matching shim
//! export below. The wasm type signatures are identical by construction
//! (both sides are plain Rust functions of matching types), so the
//! rewrite is a drop-in body replacement.
//!
//! The `#[used]` static on each shim keeps it from being DCE'd before
//! post-link processing sees the file.
