# codepod Kernel / Userland Separation

## Status

Draft, design phase. No code merged. Replaces no existing spec; predecessor
to a CPython port effort and to follow-on userland-package reorgs.

## Outcome

Target end state — `packages/orchestrator/` becomes `packages/kernel/`, a
kernel that exposes WASI + POSIX primitives and treats the boot process
as opaque. Bash, busybox, coreutils, and (eventually) CPython all run on
top as ordinary userland `.wasm` packages. The kernel surface is
boundary-clean for new code; pre-existing Python-coupled code stays
in place as documented debt to be cleared by a follow-on CPython port.

Concretely:

- The kernel's host-facing TS API exposes `Sandbox.create({ bootArgv })`
  and a generic `process(pid).callExport(...)`. The `shell/` directory
  and `ShellInstance` class are deleted; their generic bits move into
  `process/`, their bash-specific bits move out to `mcp-server` /
  `sdk-server`.
- `host-imports/shell-imports.ts` (an entire shell-named host-imports
  module) is audited and consolidated: generic helpers fold into
  `kernel-imports.ts`; anything intrinsically shell-shaped moves out
  with the bash-dispatch wrapper.
- The shell wasm becomes a normal VFS file at `/bin/bash`, instead of
  being passed as a host filesystem path to `ShellInstance.create`.
- `host_extension_invoke` / `host_native_invoke` remain as kernel
  primitives, unchanged. They have a current consumer (RustPython); a
  future hostbridge userland design supersedes the current
  auto-create-virtual-command implementation when CPython lands.
- `codepod-server` (and `codepod-server-deno`, `codepod-mcp`) continue
  to bundle kernel TS + selected userland `.wasm` assets at build time;
  pkg-installed userland at runtime continues to work.

**Explicitly deferred to a follow-on effort** (out of scope here):
deletion of `python/`, RustPython removal, deletion of
`host_run_command`, deletion of `extension/codepod-ext-shim.ts`. These
are entangled — RustPython consumes `host_run_command` directly,
`build-mcp.sh` auto-builds `python3.wasm` via `packages/python/build.sh`,
and `Sandbox.create()` installs Python `/usr/lib/python` shims at boot.
Removing any of these in isolation regresses functionality; they should
all clear together as part of the CPython port that replaces RustPython.

The product requirement is **boundary correctness for new code**, not
all-at-once cleanup. Existing functionality is preserved end-to-end
(mcp-server, sdk-server, python-sdk all continue to operate against
bash boot, with RustPython still working).

## Problem

Today `packages/orchestrator/` mixes three concerns:

**1. The actual kernel.** `vfs/`, `process/`, `wasi/`, `host-imports/`,
`network/`, `persistence/`, `pool/`, `platform/` — these are primitives
the kernel must own.

**2. Userland-shaped code on the kernel side of the import.** Specifically:

- `host-imports/kernel-imports.ts` exports `host_run_command` — names a
  userland feature; should be `host_spawn`. (Deferred: RustPython
  consumer.)
- `host-imports/shell-imports.ts` (403 lines) is an entire shell-named
  module within `host-imports/`. By the naming test, the file itself is
  a violation; its contents are a mix of generic primitives that should
  fold into `kernel-imports.ts` and shell-specific helpers that should
  move out to bash-host.
- `shell/shell-instance.ts` (1157 lines) is a TS module specifically
  about *the shell*: it knows `__run_command(jsonString)`, the shell
  history, the shell-only call protocol. Generic process-loading bits
  (memory wiring, fd setup, JSPI/Asyncify, threads-backend wiring,
  resident-mode lifecycle) are entangled with bash-specific knowledge.
- `python/` carries RustPython integration: TS glue for a userland
  binary, mixed with auto-create-virtual-command machinery used to
  thunk Python extensions to host functions. (Deferred: clears with
  CPython port.)
- `extension/codepod-ext-shim.ts` literally embeds Python source for
  `/usr/lib/python/codepod_ext.py`. (Deferred.)
- `Sandbox.create()` installs Python `/usr/lib/python` shims,
  `sitecustomize.py`, and socket/ssl/requests shims directly from
  orchestrator. (Deferred: clears when the Python userland package
  takes over its own shim install.)

**3. Userland-package metadata.** `packages/orchestrator/src/packages/`
carries the manifest parser and tool registry — kernel concerns (the
kernel installs at boot and at runtime), but conflated with packaging
specifics.

The problem this causes:

- Replacing `bash` with another boot binary requires kernel changes.
- Replacing RustPython with CPython requires touching kernel code.
- New userland (e.g., a hostbridge wasm) has no clear shape, because the
  Python-specific machinery sits where reusable mechanism should live.
- Code review can't enforce "kernel doesn't know about userland" because
  the boundary isn't named.

The fix is to commit to the boundary: rename `orchestrator/` → `kernel/`,
factor the generic process loader out of `shell-instance.ts`, audit
and consolidate `shell-imports.ts`, install `/bin/bash` as a real VFS
file, and move the bash-specific dispatch to the host servers that
need it. Python-coupled debt (`python/`, `host_run_command`,
`extension/codepod-ext-shim.ts`, `Sandbox.create()` Python shim
install) is deferred to a follow-on CPython port.

## Boundary Principle

Two-pronged test for "is this kernel?":

1. **Naming test.** A kernel symbol must name a primitive (`spawn`,
   `pipe`, `read_fd`, `mutex_lock`, `extension_invoke`). It must not
   name a userland feature (`run_command`, `shell_*`, `python_*`).
2. **Agnosticism test.** The kernel's behavior must not depend on
   *which* userland is running. Replacing bash with another binary at
   boot must require zero kernel changes.

Both prongs apply to *new* code in this refactor. Existing boundary
violations are tracked as documented debt and cleared in dedicated
follow-on efforts:

- **Python-shaped code** (`python/`, `extension/codepod-ext-shim.ts`,
  `host_run_command`, the `Sandbox.create()` Python `/usr/lib/python`
  shim install) — clears with the CPython port that replaces
  RustPython.
- **`host_extension_invoke` naming** — "extension" is a host-plugin
  abstraction, not a primitive like `pipe`/`spawn`. Marginal; not
  worth renaming until hostbridge lands.

The boundary principle is *aspirational* for legacy code and
*enforceable* for any code added by this refactor.

**Anti-weaponization.** Touching deferred Python-coupled code during
this refactor (e.g., editing `sandbox.ts` and noticing the Python
shim install nearby) does *not* obligate the editor to clean it up.
Cleanup of deferred items is bundled into the CPython port. Reviewers
should not block PRs in this refactor on grounds that they "should
have also fixed" deferred Python debt.

## Source-Tree Changes

### Rename

- `packages/orchestrator/` → `packages/kernel/`.
- npm package `@codepod/sandbox` → `@codepod/kernel`.
- Internal layout under `packages/kernel/src/` keeps existing dirs
  (`vfs/`, `process/`, `wasi/`, `host-imports/`, `network/`,
  `persistence/`, `pool/`, `platform/`, `packages/`, `pkg/`,
  `execution/`, `extension/`). `python/` also stays for now (Python
  debt — see Out of Scope). `shell/` is removed (carved out in PR4).
- All imports across the workspace updated (`mcp-server`, `sdk-server`,
  others).

### Delete

- `packages/orchestrator/src/shell/shell-instance.ts` and the entire
  `shell/` directory inside the kernel package — after carve-out
  (below) and after all consumers have switched to the new generic
  API.
- All tests under `shell/__tests__/` that exercise the deleted
  `ShellInstance` API directly. (Conformance tests that exercise
  `/bin/bash` end-to-end stay; they target the boot process via the
  new generic API.)

### Carve Out

`packages/orchestrator/src/shell/shell-instance.ts` (1157 lines) is
split:

- **Generic bits stay in kernel** → `packages/kernel/src/process/`:
  process spawn, memory wiring, fd setup, host-imports wiring,
  JSPI/Asyncify call-export plumbing, threads-backend wiring (the
  wasi-threads code we just landed), the resident-export-driven
  process model (see §Boot Process Model — Resident Mode).
- **Bash-specific bits move out** → `sdk-server/src/bash-dispatch.ts`
  and `mcp-server/src/bash-dispatch.ts` (~50 lines each, near
  duplicates). The `__run_command` JSON protocol and the result-shape
  parsing live there. Any other bash-only state currently held in
  `shell-instance.ts` (history, pending-output buffers) moves with it.

`packages/orchestrator/src/host-imports/shell-imports.ts` (403 lines)
is audited and split. The current shell binary depends on a wider
import surface than `kernel-imports.ts` declares. Every entry in
`shell-imports.ts` falls into one of three buckets:

- **Generic primitive** — same as `kernel-imports.ts` modulo a sync
  vs async difference or argv-encoding tweak. Examples: `host_pipe`,
  `host_spawn`, `host_read_fd`, `host_write_fd`. **Action:** fold
  into `kernel-imports.ts`. The two import-builder functions
  converge into one; differences become configuration options
  (e.g., a `syncSpawn` callback for synchronous testing).

- **Shell-legacy convenience import** — file-system convenience
  helpers and shell-only fixtures that were added when the shell
  needed quick access. By the naming test these violate the boundary,
  even where they happen to be useful primitives.
  Concrete enumeration: `host_stat`, `host_read_file`,
  `host_write_file`, `host_readdir`, `host_mkdir`, `host_remove`,
  `host_chmod`, `host_glob`, `host_rename`, `host_readlink`,
  `host_register_tool`, `host_has_tool`, `host_time`. **Action:**
  move out wholesale to `bash-host` alongside `bash-dispatch.ts`.
  These are linked into the shell binary's import object only when
  it boots; the kernel exposes none of them.

  Long-term: the shell should be rebuilt to use WASI Preview 1
  (`fd_read`, `path_open`, `path_filestat_get`, …) and `host_spawn`
  for these. That migration is a follow-up port effort, not part of
  this refactor.

- **Truly shell-specific helper** — the host-side glob expansion
  path that walks VFS for the shell. Kept with the shell-legacy
  bucket above; moves to `bash-host`.

After this PR, `shell-imports.ts` either no longer exists (every
helper folded or moved) or contains only the shell-legacy bucket
awaiting its move to `bash-host` in PR4.

Intra-orchestrator consumers of `ShellInstance` are rewired in PR4
(see Migration Plan):

- `packages/orchestrator/src/sandbox.ts` — three `ShellInstance.create`
  call sites (creation + `fork()`).
- `packages/orchestrator/src/cli.ts` — one call site.
- `packages/orchestrator/src/index.ts` — one re-export.
- `packages/orchestrator/src/execution/execution-worker.ts` and
  `packages/orchestrator/src/execution/worker-executor.ts` — both
  import `ShellInstance` directly. The worker bridge is rewritten to
  use the generic Process API; the bash-protocol awareness, if any,
  goes through the host-side bash-dispatch module.

### Untouched in This Refactor

- Userland sibling packages (`shell-exec/`, `coreutils/`,
  `pdf-tools/`, `sips/`, `sqlite/`, `xlsx-tools/`, the
  matplotlib/numpy/pandas/pillow ports) stay where they are. No
  `packages/userland/` umbrella.
  - `packages/guest-compat/` is also untouched, but currently only
    exists in the `feature/wasi-threads` and `guest-compat-step-1`
    branches. This refactor assumes those branches merge to `main`
    before PR1 starts — or, equivalently, the kernel-rename PR sweeps
    over whatever set of userland packages happens to be on `main` at
    that time.
- `python/`, `extension/codepod-ext-shim.ts`, `host_run_command`, and
  the auto-create-virtual-command machinery — all stay in place as
  documented Python-coupled debt. They clear together when CPython
  lands.
- `host_extension_invoke` / `host_native_invoke` stay as kernel
  primitives, unchanged. RustPython continues to consume them.
- `codepod-server` build pipeline structure unchanged.
- The manifest format itself is unchanged. The manifest parser stays
  in kernel.

## Kernel Surface

### Guest-facing imports (`codepod::host_*`)

The full list after the refactor.

**Process management:**

- `host_pipe()` → `{read_fd, write_fd}`
- `host_spawn(req)` → pid
- `host_waitpid(pid)` → `{exit_code}` (async/JSPI)
- `host_waitpid_nohang(pid)` → exit_code
- `host_close_fd(fd)` → 0/-1
- `host_getpid()` → i32
- `host_getppid()` → i32
- `host_kill(pid, sig)` → 0/-1
- `host_list_processes()` → JSON array

**File-descriptor I/O:**

- `host_read_fd(fd, out_ptr, out_cap)` → bytes_read
- `host_write_fd(fd, data_ptr, data_len)` → bytes_written
- `host_dup(fd, out_ptr, out_cap)` → `{fd}`
- `host_dup2(src_fd, dst_fd)` → 0/-1

**Networking:**

- `host_network_fetch(req, out_ptr, out_cap)` (async)
- `host_socket_connect(req, out_ptr, out_cap)`
- `host_socket_send(req, out_ptr, out_cap)`
- `host_socket_recv(req, out_ptr, out_cap)`
- `host_socket_close(req)`

**Threading** (gated by `threadsBackend`):

- `host_thread_spawn(fn_ptr, arg)` (async)
- `host_thread_join(tid)` (async)
- `host_thread_detach(tid)` (async)
- `host_thread_self()` → tid
- `host_thread_yield()` (async)
- `host_mutex_lock(ptr)` (async)
- `host_mutex_unlock(ptr)`
- `host_mutex_trylock(ptr)` → 0/1
- `host_cond_wait(ptr, mutex_ptr)` (async)
- `host_cond_signal(ptr)`
- `host_cond_broadcast(ptr)`

**Dynamic extension dispatch** (no current consumer):

- `host_extension_invoke(req, out_ptr, out_cap)` (async)
- `host_native_invoke(module, method, args, out_ptr, out_cap)`

**Control flow:**

- `host_setjmp(env_ptr)` → 0 (current implementation is a stub
  returning 0; full implementation deferred to a separate spec)
- `host_longjmp(env_ptr, val)` (stub; throws — same status as
  `host_setjmp`)
- `host_yield()` (async microtask yield)

**Deferred to the CPython-port effort (NOT removed by this refactor):**

- `host_run_command` — RustPython's `codepod-host` crate still consumes
  it directly, and `build-coreutils.sh` marks it as an asyncify import.
  The import name stays. **What changes in PR4:** today its handler
  in `kernel-imports.ts` is wrapped by `ShellInstance` (which adds
  JSPI/Asyncify and dispatches to the running shell wasm via
  `__run_command`). Since PR4 deletes `ShellInstance`, the handler
  is rewired to call a **host-registered callback** — a small
  TypeScript hook the host server passes to `Sandbox.create` (the
  same registration mechanism `kernel.registerExtension` will use
  for hostbridge). `mcp-server` and `sdk-server` both register a
  bash-aware callback that invokes
  `sandbox.process(1).callExport("__run_command", ...)`. Result:
  the kernel's `host_run_command` HANDLER becomes generic (delegate
  to a registered callback); userland-shaped knowledge of "the boot
  process speaks `__run_command`" lives only in the host server's
  registered callback. RustPython works unchanged. Future guests
  use `host_spawn` directly; the `host_run_command` import goes
  away with RustPython.

Plus the standard WASI Preview 1 surface (`fd_read`, `fd_write`,
`path_open`, …) handled by the kernel's WASI host.

### Host-facing TS API

The TS surface that `mcp-server`, `sdk-server`, and other hosts use.

**Sandbox lifecycle:**

- `Sandbox.create({ bootArgv, env?, vfs?, threadsBackend?, network?,
  persistence?, … })` — `bootArgv[0]` is spawned as PID 1. **No `bash`
  or `shell` parameter.** Default supplied by the *caller* (typically
  `["/bin/bash"]`).
- `Sandbox.destroy()` — tears down.
- `Sandbox.fork()`, `Sandbox.snapshot()`, `Sandbox.restore()` —
  existing, unchanged.

**Process control (generic):**

- `sandbox.process(pid)` → `Process` with:
  - `.callExport(name, args)` — invoke a wasm export, JSPI/Asyncify-aware.
    Replaces today's shell-instance `__run_command` plumbing.
  - `.fd(n).read(n)` / `.fd(n).write(buf)` — generic fd I/O.
  - `.kill(sig)`, `.waitpid()`, `.exitCode`.
- `sandbox.spawn(argv, opts)` → `Process` — host-side mirror of
  `host_spawn`.

**VFS:**

- `sandbox.fs.read/write/list/...` — existing surface, unchanged in
  shape.

**Extensions:**

- `kernel.registerExtension(name, fn)` — installs a TS function
  reachable via `host_extension_invoke`. RustPython is the current
  consumer of `host_extension_invoke` (and `host_native_invoke`)
  via the auto-create-virtual-command machinery, which itself stays
  in place as Python-coupled debt; the public
  `kernel.registerExtension` host API is new in this refactor and
  has no current consumer at the time of writing — future hostbridge
  userland will be its first.

**Removed from host API:**

- `Sandbox.run(command, callbacks?)` (currently
  `packages/orchestrator/src/sandbox.ts:537`).
- `Sandbox.getHistory()` (sandbox.ts:719) and `Sandbox.clearHistory()`
  (sandbox.ts:725).
- Any other shell-shaped surface on `Sandbox`.

Consumers (sdk-server at `packages/sdk-server/src/dispatcher.ts:218`,
mcp-server at `packages/mcp-server/src/index.ts:282`, plus internal
callers) replace `sandbox.run(cmd)` with their host-side
`bashDispatch.runCommand(sandbox, cmd)` wrapper, which calls
`sandbox.process(1).callExport("__run_command", ...)`. Shell history
becomes the host server's responsibility (or is dropped — neither
mcp-server nor sdk-server appears to surface it externally).

## Boot Process Model

### Resident Mode vs CLI Mode

A wasm process under codepod runs in one of two modes:

- **CLI mode (default).** The process's `_start` runs to completion;
  WASI `proc_exit` ends the process; the wasm instance is discarded.
  Standard for most binaries (`ls`, `awk`, `jq`).
- **Resident mode (export-driven).** The process's `_start` runs to
  completion (typically calling `proc_exit(0)` after one-time
  initialization), but the **wasm instance and its memory are
  retained**. The host then drives further work by calling exported
  functions (e.g., `__run_command`). The process is logically alive
  even though `_start` returned.

The current shell binary runs in resident mode. The current
`ShellInstance` already implements this: it intercepts `proc_exit(0)`
during boot, retains the instance, and dispatches `__run_command` on
it. **This refactor preserves resident mode as a generic kernel
capability, decoupled from "shell".**

`Process` exposes a `mode: "cli" | "resident"` flag. Resident-mode
semantics:

- `proc_exit(0)` during `_start` (boot) → caught, treated as
  "initialization complete"; the wasm instance is retained.
- `proc_exit(N)` for N != 0 during `_start` → boot failed; instance
  dropped; `Sandbox.create` rejects with `E_BOOT_FAILED`.
- `proc_exit(N)` from within an exported call (e.g., the shell's
  `exit 1` builtin propagating up to wasm) → today's
  `ShellInstance` does not catch this at the export boundary; it
  throws and propagates as a trap. **This refactor preserves that
  behavior.** A resident-mode `proc_exit` mid-call is therefore
  fatal: the call rejects with `E_PROCESS_TRAP` and (if the process
  is PID 1) the sandbox transitions to "exited". Userland (the
  shell binary itself) is responsible for *not* calling `proc_exit`
  during a `__run_command` invocation if it wants to stay alive —
  exit codes for the *requested command* travel through the
  request/response payload, not through `proc_exit`.
- Explicit `Process.terminate()` from the host ends a resident
  process.

The boot process (PID 1) defaults to resident mode. Other userland
binaries default to CLI mode. The mode is configured per-spawn:
`host_spawn` accepts an optional `mode` field for guests that want
to launch a long-running export-driven child (rare; not currently
exercised by any in-tree binary).

### Boot at Sandbox Creation

`Sandbox.create({ bootArgv })`:

1. Validates `bootArgv[0]` resolves to an executable in the VFS.
   Specifically: there must be a regular file or symlink at that
   path, readable, with wasm magic bytes. Otherwise → error
   (`E_BOOT_NOT_FOUND` if missing, `E_BOOT_NOT_EXECUTABLE` if not
   wasm).
2. Spawns it as **PID 1** in resident mode.
3. Awaits initialization (PID 1's `_start` runs to its first
   `proc_exit(0)` or to a host-defined "ready" signal). If `_start`
   throws or `proc_exit(N)` for N != 0 fires before init completes,
   `Sandbox.create` rejects with `E_BOOT_FAILED` and the wasm
   instance is dropped.
4. Returns the live Sandbox.

### Boot Error Paths

Every transition has a defined error:

- **Boot binary missing in VFS** → `Sandbox.create` rejects with
  `E_BOOT_NOT_FOUND`.
- **Boot binary not executable wasm** → `Sandbox.create` rejects with
  `E_BOOT_NOT_EXECUTABLE`.
- **Instantiation throws** (link error, host-import mismatch,
  start-trap) → `Sandbox.create` rejects with `E_BOOT_FAILED`,
  carrying the underlying error.
- **PID 1 exits non-zero during init** → `Sandbox.create` rejects with
  `E_BOOT_FAILED`.
- **PID 1 exits after `Sandbox.create` returns** (CLI-style or
  unexpected exit) → sandbox transitions to "exited"; subsequent
  host calls reject with `E_SANDBOX_EXITED`. Pending operations are
  cancelled.
- **PID 1 traps during a `callExport`** → that single call rejects
  with `E_PROCESS_TRAP`; the sandbox stays alive only if the trap was
  caught and the instance is still consistent. By default, traps in
  PID 1 are fatal (sandbox transitions to "exited").

### Init-Process Semantics for PID 1

- Orphan reaping: child processes whose parent dies get reparented to
  PID 1 (standard Unix behavior). This already exists in
  `process/manager.ts`.
- PID 1 cannot be killed by signals from inside the sandbox. (Existing
  behavior; kept.)

### Bash-Dispatch Wrapper (Host-Side)

Each host server carries a small TS module that holds the bash-specific
protocol. Example shape (the same in `sdk-server/src/bash-dispatch.ts`
and `mcp-server/src/bash-dispatch.ts`):

```ts
async function runCommand(
  sandbox: Sandbox,
  cmd: string,
  opts?: RunOpts,
): Promise<RunResult> {
  const raw = await sandbox.process(1).callExport(
    "__run_command",
    JSON.stringify({ cmd, ...opts }),
  );
  return JSON.parse(raw); // { exit_code, stdout, stderr, ... }
}
```

This is the *only* place that knows:

1. The boot process is bash.
2. Bash exposes `__run_command(jsonString)` as its dispatch entrypoint.
3. The request/response JSON shape.

Swap the boot default → only this file (×2) changes. ~50 lines
duplicated across two consumers is acceptable; promote to a shared
`packages/bash-host/` if a third consumer ever appears.

### VFS Prerequisite — Install Step Required

`/bin/bash` must exist in the VFS at boot. **This is not satisfied
today.** Currently, `mcp-server` and `sdk-server` pass a host
filesystem path (`shellExecWasmPath`) to `ShellInstance.create`, and
the wasm bytes are loaded directly from disk — never written into the
sandbox VFS.

Migration requires an explicit install step (PR1 in the migration
plan):

1. The host server reads the shell wasm bytes once at startup (from
   embedded asset or filesystem path, as today).
2. At sandbox creation, the kernel writes those bytes to `/bin/bash`
   in the sandbox's VFS, marked executable. (Or a symlink from
   `/bin/bash` to wherever the wasm package's manifest places its
   binary, once the manifest-driven model is fully in play.)
3. After this install step, `bootArgv: ["/bin/bash"]` resolves to a
   real VFS file.

The wasm bytes themselves continue to come from the host server's
embedded bundle (no build pipeline change). Only the *delivery* into
the sandbox changes: host-fs path → VFS file at `/bin/bash`.

### Fork & Snapshot

`Sandbox.fork()` clones VFS state, then spawns a fresh PID 1 in the
child using **the parent's `bootArgv`**. The kernel does retain
knowledge of the boot command — but only as opaque sandbox metadata
(a `bootArgv: string[]` field), not as embedded "this is the shell"
logic. Replacing the parent's boot binary still requires zero kernel
changes.

`Sandbox.snapshot/restore` capture and replay sandbox state including
`bootArgv` *and* the VFS contents (so `/bin/bash` is in the
snapshotted VFS — no need to re-resolve `bootArgv[0]` against the
host server at restore time). For snapshots that capture wasm memory,
the captured PID 1 instance is restored directly, skipping the
re-instantiate-and-await-init path entirely (existing behavior).

### Public API Change

Today's callers pass shell options; the orchestrator implicitly knows
bash is the default and wires shell-instance. After this refactor,
callers pass `bootArgv`. `mcp-server` / `sdk-server` set their default
to `["/bin/bash"]`. This is a public API change for any external
consumer of `@codepod/sandbox`, but our two callers are in-tree,
so it's a sweep.

## Migration Plan

Six PRs, each merges independently and keeps `main` green. Python work
is **out of scope** throughout (clears in a separate CPython-port
effort).

### PR1 — Install shell wasm into VFS as `/bin/bash`

- The host server signature is unchanged: `ShellInstance.create(...,
  shellExecWasmPath, ...)` continues to accept a host filesystem
  path. The kernel internally reads bytes from that path and writes
  them to `/bin/bash` in the sandbox VFS, marked executable, before
  spawning the shell.
- Existing in-memory wasm-bytes paths (e.g., the embedded-asset
  variants) get the same treatment: kernel writes the bytes into
  VFS first, then spawns from VFS.
- Add a unit test asserting that immediately after `Sandbox.create`,
  the sandbox VFS has a readable, executable `/bin/bash`.

**Why first:** the entire boot model (PR3, PR4) depends on
`bootArgv: ["/bin/bash"]` resolving to a real VFS path. This step is
a strict prerequisite and is independently verifiable.

**Risk:** low. Additive; no behavior change beyond an extra VFS file.

**Verification:** unit tests, guest-compat tests, mcp-server +
sdk-server smoke tests, `python-sdk` end-to-end.

### PR2 — Generic process loader (carve-out, additive)

- Inside `packages/orchestrator/src/process/`, factor the generic
  loader out of `shell/shell-instance.ts`:
  - `Process` class with `.callExport()`, `.fd(n).read/write`, exit
    handling.
  - JSPI/Asyncify wrapping plumbing moves into the generic path.
  - Threads-backend wiring (just-landed wasi-threads) moves with it.
  - `mode: "cli" | "resident"` flag on `Process`. Resident-mode
    processes intercept `proc_exit(0)` during boot as
    "initialization complete"; CLI-mode processes terminate on
    `proc_exit`.
- Add `Sandbox.create({ bootArgv, … })`. **For this PR**,
  orchestrator still defaults `bootArgv` to `["/bin/bash"]` if not
  provided, to keep existing callers working without change. This
  default is **transitional** — it preserves the existing implicit
  behavior, not a new convention. The default goes away in PR4 when
  host servers take over.
- Reduce `shell-instance.ts` to a thin wrapper around the new Process
  API. Still does `__run_command` dispatch but spawn / imports /
  JSPI / resident-mode are now via the generic loader. The thin
  wrapper duplicates a small amount of logic with the new generic
  path during PR2; that duplication clears in PR4.

**Risk:** medium. Verify JSPI/Asyncify + threads-backend still work
via the guest-compat pthread canary. End-to-end Python-SDK round-trip.
Resident-mode behavior must match today's `ShellInstance` exactly.

**Verification:** unit tests, guest-compat pthread canary (4-thread
mutex stress, asserts counter == 40000), mcp-server + sdk-server smoke
tests, Python-SDK round-trip.

### PR3 — Audit `host-imports/shell-imports.ts`

- Compare `kernel-imports.ts` and `shell-imports.ts` import-by-import.
- For each import in `shell-imports.ts`:
  - **Generic** (e.g., process spawn, fd I/O, argv decoding): merge
    with the corresponding `kernel-imports.ts` entry; lift any
    behavioral difference into a configuration option.
  - **Shell-specific** (e.g., glob expansion against VFS): mark for
    move to `bash-host`. Defer the actual move to PR4 (where
    bash-dispatch lands), but the audit / categorization happens
    here.
- After this PR, `shell-imports.ts` either no longer exists (if every
  helper folded into kernel-imports) or contains only the
  shell-specific helpers awaiting their move in PR4.

**Risk:** medium-high. Folding two import builders into one with
config flags risks silent behavioral divergence — sync vs async
paths, different argv encoding, sign-extension on ptr/len pairs.
Mitigation: every PR3 change is gated on a side-by-side import-name
+ signature parity assertion (a unit test that instantiates the
post-PR3 imports against a recorded pre-PR3 baseline of names and
arities).

**Verification:** unit tests, guest-compat tests, mcp-server +
sdk-server smoke tests, Python-SDK round-trip. Targeted test that
spawns the shell and runs `ls /`, `find -name '*.txt'`, `echo *`
(exercises any shell-specific glob path).

### PR4 — Rewire all `ShellInstance` consumers; move bash-dispatch out

This is the substantive PR; it does what (B) was always going to
require.

- Create `sdk-server/src/bash-dispatch.ts` and
  `mcp-server/src/bash-dispatch.ts` (~50 lines each, near duplicates).
  They wrap `sandbox.process(1).callExport("__run_command", …)`.
- Switch all `ShellInstance` consumers to the new Process API:
  - `packages/orchestrator/src/sandbox.ts` (3 call sites incl.
    `fork()`).
  - `packages/orchestrator/src/cli.ts` (1 call site).
  - `packages/orchestrator/src/index.ts` (1 re-export — drop or
    re-export the new generic API).
  - `packages/orchestrator/src/execution/execution-worker.ts` and
    `worker-executor.ts` — rewrite the worker bridge to use **only
    the generic Process API**. Worker bridge becomes pure
    process-execution: spawn process, wire fds, callExport on the
    boot process, return result. **No dependency on bash-dispatch
    from inside the kernel package** — that would invert the
    layering (kernel → host server). If the worker bridge needs to
    invoke `__run_command` on PID 1, the calling host server passes
    the command through; the worker just routes it via the generic
    Process API.
- Move shell-legacy imports identified in PR3 (`host_stat`,
  `host_read_file`, `host_register_tool`, etc. — the full list in
  §Source-Tree Changes / Carve Out) out of kernel `host-imports/`
  to the bash-host module(s). They get assembled into the boot
  process's import object only when bash boots.
- Rewire `host_run_command`'s kernel-imports.ts handler to delegate
  to a host-registered callback (passed via `Sandbox.create` opts
  alongside `bootArgv`). Both `mcp-server` and `sdk-server` register
  a bash-aware callback that calls
  `sandbox.process(1).callExport("__run_command", ...)`. RustPython
  consumers continue to work with no changes.
- Delete `Sandbox.run`, `Sandbox.getHistory`, `Sandbox.clearHistory`
  from the public host API. Consumers (mcp-server's `run_command`
  tool at `index.ts:282`, sdk-server's dispatcher at `dispatcher.ts:218`,
  any internal callers) switch to the host-side
  `bashDispatch.runCommand(sandbox, cmd)` wrapper.
- Move the `bootArgv` default out of orchestrator and into each host
  server. Kernel's `Sandbox.create` now **requires** `bootArgv`.
- Delete `packages/orchestrator/src/shell/shell-instance.ts` and the
  `shell/` directory.

**Risk:** high. Largest blast radius of the migration; touches every
in-tree consumer.

**Verification:** unit tests, guest-compat tests, mcp-server +
sdk-server smoke tests, Python-SDK end-to-end (`Sandbox()`,
`sb.commands.run("ls /")`), explicit `Sandbox.fork()` test (verifies
bootArgv inheritance).

### PR5 — Rename `orchestrator/` → `kernel/`

- `git mv packages/orchestrator packages/kernel`.
- `package.json` name → `@codepod/kernel`.
- Update imports workspace-wide (`mcp-server`, `sdk-server`, others).
- Update `scripts/build-sdk-server.sh`, `scripts/build-mcp.sh`,
  `CLAUDE.md`.

**Risk:** low. Mechanical, but big diff. Pure rename — no behavior
change. By landing after PR4, the diff contains *only* the rename, no
content shifts.

**Verification:** unit tests, guest-compat tests, mcp-server +
sdk-server smoke tests, Python-SDK end-to-end. Build
`dist/codepod-server` and `dist/codepod-mcp` from scratch.

### PR6 — Documentation + boundary marker

- `packages/kernel/README.md` documenting:
  - The boundary principle (naming + agnosticism tests, with the
    "aspirational for legacy code, enforceable for new code"
    qualifier).
  - Guest-facing imports list.
  - Host-facing TS API.
  - The "USERLAND PROTOCOL handled by host" note for the bash-dispatch.
  - The "Python-coupled debt cleared by CPython port" note pointing
    at `python/`, `host_run_command`, `extension/codepod-ext-shim.ts`.
- Comments on `host_extension_invoke` / `host_native_invoke`
  documenting the future hostbridge consumer.

**Risk:** zero.

### Why Six Small PRs

The previous five-PR plan combined too much into PR1 (Python
deletions that can't actually land alone) and underspecified PR3
(missed `shell-imports.ts`, `execution/`, intra-orchestrator
consumers). Splitting into six gives each PR a single failure mode
and lets PR5 (the rename) be purely mechanical.

### Verification Per PR

For every PR:

- All unit tests pass.
- guest-compat tests pass (especially the pthread canary — must
  preserve the wasi-threads work that just landed).
- mcp-server + sdk-server smoke tests.
- `python-sdk` end-to-end (`Sandbox()`, `sb.commands.run("ls /")`).

## Out of Scope

Explicitly *not* in this refactor:

- **All Python work** — bundled together as a follow-on CPython-port
  effort. Specifically deferred:
  - Deletion of `packages/orchestrator/src/python/`.
  - Deletion of `host_run_command` (RustPython consumer).
  - Deletion of `extension/codepod-ext-shim.ts` (Python source for
    `/usr/lib/python/codepod_ext.py`).
  - Removal of the auto-create-virtual-command machinery.
  - Removal of Python `/usr/lib/python` shim install in
    `Sandbox.create()`.
  - Removal of `packages/python/` and `python3.wasm` from the build.
  - RustPython replacement by CPython.

  These are entangled (build, runtime, tests) and would normally clear
  together. **Escape hatch:** if any individual PR in this refactor
  turns out to be blocked by Python coupling we didn't anticipate
  (e.g. `sandbox.ts` rewire can't proceed without untangling the
  Python shim install, or `execution/` worker bridge can't be
  generalized while RustPython hooks into it), we drop RustPython
  inline rather than working around it. Deferral is for
  functionality-preservation, not for Python being load-bearing.

- **Hostbridge implementation.** The `host_extension_invoke` /
  `host_native_invoke` primitives stay unchanged. The `/bin/hostbridge`
  userland wasm + `kernel.registerExtension(...)` integration are
  designed but unimplemented in this refactor — they land with the
  CPython port.
- **`packages/userland/` umbrella.** Userland sibling packages stay
  where they are. Reorg deferred until there's enough userland to
  make a flat list unwieldy.
- **Hard import-boundary lint.** The "kernel can't import from
  userland" rule is enforced by review for now. Promotable to a
  dependency-cruiser rule later.
- **Manifest format changes.** The package manifest (file lists,
  symlinks, multicall applets) is unchanged. The parser stays in
  kernel.
- **`codepod-server` build pipeline structure.** Bundling kernel +
  selected userland into a single binary continues unchanged.
- **Renaming `host_extension_invoke`.** "Extension" is arguably a
  host-plugin abstraction rather than a primitive. Worth revisiting
  when hostbridge lands; not worth the churn now.

## Open Questions / Future Work

These are *not* gating this refactor but are worth noting:

- **CPython port — the headline consumer.** Linking CPython against
  guest-compat → kernel primitives is the reason this refactor
  matters. That effort also clears all the deferred Python items
  listed under Out of Scope. Spec lands separately.
- **Hostbridge implementation.** When CPython lands and needs native
  modules, build `/bin/hostbridge` (a tiny wasm that reads `argv[0]`
  and calls `host_extension_invoke`) plus the
  `kernel.registerExtension(name, fn)` host API. Symlinks named after
  extensions point at `/bin/hostbridge`. This pattern supersedes the
  current auto-create-virtual-command implementation.
- **Promote bash-dispatch to a shared package.** If a third consumer
  appears, move `bash-dispatch.ts` from per-host duplication to
  `packages/bash-host/`.
- **`packages/userland/` umbrella.** Once we have bash, busybox,
  CPython, jq, file, sqlite, … as separate packages, a flat list
  under `packages/` may become unwieldy. Defer.
- **Hard import-boundary lint.** Add a dependency-cruiser rule
  enforcing kernel cannot import from userland.
- **POSIX-facade extension.** Additional kernel primitives (full
  signal delivery, real PTY, more of POSIX) follow on top of this
  cleanly-bounded kernel.
- **Naming clash with `packages/codepod-process/`.** The Rust crate
  `codepod-process` (a guest-side wrapper around `host_spawn` /
  `host_waitpid`) lives next to a refactor that promotes "process"
  terminology in the kernel API (`sandbox.process(pid)`,
  `packages/kernel/src/process/`). They sit on opposite sides of the
  boundary so collision risk is low, but a one-line note in
  `codepod-process/README.md` clarifies which side it belongs to.
- **`host_extension_invoke` rename.** Possibly to `host_plugin_invoke`
  or `host_callback_invoke` to better satisfy the naming test. Not a
  blocker; revisit when hostbridge actually lands.
