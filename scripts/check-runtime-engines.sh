==> Runtime engine smoke complete

Coverage note:
- Node and Bun execute the TypeScript kernel package as JS hosts.
- Wasmtime and Wasmer run plain WASI canaries directly.
- Wasmtime SDK-server integration is available with CODEPOD_RUNTIME_FULL=1.
- There is no Wasmer SDK-server backend yet; add one before treating Wasmer as
  full-kernel coverage.
